## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following R packages installed. You can install them using the following commands:

```R
install.packages("readxl")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("psych")
install.packages("gridExtra")
```

The required packages for this project are:

- `readxl`
- `dplyr`
- `ggplot2`
- `psych`
- `gridExtra`

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have:

1. R installed on your system. You can download it from [R Project website](https://www.r-project.org/).

2. Ames Housing dataset file (`ames.xlsx`) available in the project directory.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the code on your system:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AliNaveed01/Advance-Statistics-and-DS-Using-R.git
   ```

2. Install the required R packages:

   ```R
   install.packages(c("readxl", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "psych", "gridExtra"))
   ```

3. Open R or RStudio and run the code from the provided R script.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `ames.xlsx`: Ames Housing dataset file.
- `analysis_script.R`: R script containing the analysis code.

## Data Analysis

The code performs the following tasks:

1. Descriptive statistics of the dataset.
2. Data preprocessing for quality assurance.
3. Selection of relevant independent variables.
4. Visualization of the data using various plots.

## Linear Regression Models

The code fits and evaluates several linear regression models on the Ames Housing dataset, both simple and multiple regressions. The results are printed to the console, and R-squared values are calculated for model evaluation.
